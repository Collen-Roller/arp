# Aircraft Registration Prefix (ARP) Dataset

This dataset contains country specific aircraft registration code expressions separated by country. The database also contains a description of each codeset with both 2 and 3 letter ISO country codes following the ISO-3166 standard.

## Stats
In total, the dataset contains a total of 408 unique regular expressions to describe aircraft tail numbers across 217 unique countries. 

## Using the Data
Of course, everyone has a programming language of choice. Mine for this effort was Python. I've including a wrapper class classed "ARP" which you can use to parse through the expressions.

## Testing
To evaluate how well the regular expressions work, we extracted unique tail numbers from a years worth of air traffic from FlightRadar24.com In total, we evaluated over 250k unique tail numbers against the regular expressions to minimize duplicate tags. In total, the parser was around 98% accurate in matching tail numbers to a specific country. Of course this could be improved, but that's why this library is open-source :)

## Registration Numbers
